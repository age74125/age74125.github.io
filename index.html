<H1 style="font-family:verdana;"> Why I Grew to Love Running</h1>

<em>Website by Allie ElGomayel</em>
<p> My freshmen year of high school I got into running. It started as an exercise because I had recently quit year round swimming but turned into something much more. My freshmen year I joined the high school cross country team, really just for social purposes. Little did I know this sport would lead me to learn much more about myself and turn into something that I will continue for the rest of my life. I want to share some of the many reasons why I love to run.<p>
<h2> It taught me how to push myself</h2>
<p> I have always been very competitive which is why I enjoyed swimming so much. Running cross country allowed me with the oppurtunity to alwayws want to do better. I was always looking for ways to improve my times, technique, and focus. This motivation continued as I saw my times improving the harder I worked. I loved this feeling. This sport allowed me to use my competitive mindset to better myself. I ended up lettering and placing at the state championship. All of my hard work payed off.<p>
<h2>It became a way to escape</h2>
<p> Like most people in high school, I had to learn to adjust. The new school work and independence that came with being a high schooler was stressful at times. I quickly found that running was an escape from reality. I never found myself thinking about stressful situations while I was running. It is almost like everystep I took, a negative thought stepped out of my brain. It became a way to clear my head, and it still is today.<p>
<h2> Running Is Rewarding</h2>
<p> When I first started this whole running thing, I did not realize how far it would go. I never expected that I would be able to run 6 consecutive miles. I crossed that off my list at the peachtree road race. After that, I never thought that I would be able to run 13 miles. I crossed that off my list at the Athens half marathon last year. The reason why I love running is because there is always a way for me to improve. I can improve my form, my time, or even further my distance. The cycle of improving will never end. It allows me to feel accomplished. I will never stop running and I will always keep improving. Running is bigger than just an exercise to me, it has become a lifestyle.<p>
